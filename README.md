Clone the repository:

   ``

Navigate into the project directory:
   ``bash
   cd password-checker-generator
   ``

   ``bash
   python main.py

🚀 Usage

Open the app window.  
Type a password in the input field → get an instant strength rating!  
Click Generate Password → copy a system-generated strong password.
